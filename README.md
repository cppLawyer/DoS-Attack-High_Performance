# DoS-Attack-High_Performance

- This DoS-Attacker program is for education purposes only
- The program is written in C++ and uses openSSL and libCURL libraries
- I squeezed out all the performance so..... 

Example:


```
#include <iostream>
#include "DoS.h"

int main() {
        
DoS::Execute();

return 0;

}

```

Thats it....
